# systems

3 types of systems.
1.  CAGED
2. 7-Position
3. 3-Note-Per-String

Maybe I can put that here as well.

add 4-note-universe as well...

# update
triad mode labels now shown as scale degrees (e.g. 1-3-5, 1-3-♯5, etc.) instead of inversion names.

# Future function?
Intervalic Practice generator?
